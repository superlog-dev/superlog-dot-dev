## Commit button

You can select which files and which lines you want to include in your commit.

Suprelog will create a new branch with random generated name evey time you make a commit, but you can provide your deseired branch name as well. This is equivalent to:

<Video src="/commit2.mp4" />

<Notice title="Equivalent git commands:">

1. checkout a new branch
2. git add \(selected changes\)
3. git commit

</Notice>

---

## Uncommit button

You can use "Uncommit" button to undo the commit. This is equivalent to:

<Video src="/uncommit.mp4" />

<Notice title="Equivalent git commands:">

1. checkout parent commit hash
2. delete unused branch (local & remote)
3. soft reset HEAD~1
4. checkout current branch

</Notice>

## Split a commit

You can easily split a commit, even the middle one, by uncommitting it and then commit again.

<Video src="/split.mp4" />

---

## Git stash

There's no support for git stash in Superlog, because you can simply make a commit and uncommit it later.

<Video src="/stash.mp4" />

---

## Discard button

You can use "Discard" button to discard any selected changes.

Discard is not a recoverable operation, but your IDE might be able to undo the discard.

<Video src="/discard.mp4" />
