# Before you start coding

2 things you should do regularly:

- See which commit are you currently based on.
- Pull and rebase your unmerged commit

Then just start coding! There's no need to create new branch in advance.

<Notice title="1 commit per branch on-demand">

Superlog is optimized for workflow that has 1 commit per branch. You will be creating a new branch when you are making commit.

## Where am I?

The light blue badge marks the commit you are currently at. Any code changes will be based on that commit.

You can double click or right click on the badge to checkout the commit.

## Pull and Rebase

The key to minimize potential merge conflicts is to pull and rebase regularly, keeping the differences between your ongoing work and the latest commit in main branch minimal.

Superlog allow you to do this effortlessly.
