- How to discard changes

## Commit button

You can select which files and which lines you want to include in your commit.

Suprelog will create a new branch with random generated name evey time you make a commit, but you can provide your deseired branch name as well. This is equivalent to:

<Video src="/commit.mp4" />

<Notice title="Equivalent git commands:">

1. checkout a new branch
2. git add \(selected changes\)
3. git commit

</Notice>

---

## Uncommit button

You can use "Uncommit" button to undo the commit. This is equivalent to:

1. checkout parent branch (will create one if there's none)
2. soft reset HEAD~1
3. delete unused branch

<Video src="/uncommit.mp4" />

<Notice title="Equivalent git commands:">

1. checkout parent commit hash
2. delete unused branch (local & remote)
3. soft reset HEAD~1
4. checkout current branch (create )

</Notice>

## Git stash

There's no support for git stash in Superlog, because you can simply make a commit and uncommit it later.

---

## Discard button

You can use "Discard" button to discard any selected changes.

Discard is not a recoverable operation, but your IDE might be able to undo the discard.
