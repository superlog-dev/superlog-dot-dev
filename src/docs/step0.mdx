Superlog is a git GUI app that help you get your code into the main branch fast, easy, and error-free.

This workflow has been battle-tested within engineering team at Facebook for years, but the essential tooling wasn't avaliable for git & GitHub. Until now with Superlog.

This tutorial will demonstrate using Superlog in 5 common phases:

1. [Before coding](/docs/essentials/1-before-coding)
2. [After coding](/docs/essentials/2-after-coding)
3. [Create pull request](/docs/essentials/3-create-pr)
4. [Iterating on code review feedback](/docs/essentials/4-iterate-on-feedback)
5. [Merge pull request](/docs/essentials/5-merge-pr)

It will take about 10 minutes to finish.
