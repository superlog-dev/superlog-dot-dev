- Everything you need to know about Superlog that will boost your productivity to the maximum

</Notice>

---

Superlog is a git GUI app that helps you get your code into the main branch fast, easy, and error-free.

This workflow has been battle-tested within engineering teams at Facebook for years and rarely changes anymore.
Every engineer I know at Facebook uses this workflow with a tool called interactive-smartlog, which is the main inspriration for Superlog.

This tutorial will demonstrate using Superlog in 5 phases of your development workflow:

1. [Before coding](/docs/essentials/1-before-coding)
2. [After coding](/docs/essentials/2-after-coding)
3. [Creating pull request](/docs/essentials/3-creating-pr)
4. [Iterating on code review feedback](/docs/essentials/4-iterating-on-feedback)
5. [Merging pull request](/docs/essentials/5-merging-pr)

It will take about 10 minutes to finish.

<Notice title="Prerequisites">

System-wise:

- Your code needs to be hosted on GitHub
- You are able to checkout the repository and work on your local machine
- You are using Mac

You are okay with Superlog enforcing the workflow to have:

- One commit per pull request
- Using rebase instead of merge

If all of the above are good, it should be very easy to drop-in Superlog in your workflow.
