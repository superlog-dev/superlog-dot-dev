## Ship it! button

When you have a stack of pull request, merging them in GitHub can be error prune and tedious:

- You SHOULD merge from the bottom, but GitHub allow you to do whatever.
- You SHOULD use "Squash and merge", but GitHub allow you to use whatever.

Superlog offer "Ship it" button to prevent you from making those obvious mistake.

- The button will only shows up for base PR
- It will always uses squash and merge
