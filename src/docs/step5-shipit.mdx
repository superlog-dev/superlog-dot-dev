## Ship it! button

When you have a stack of pull request, merging them in GitHub can be error prune and tedious:

- You SHOULD merge from the bottom, but GitHub allow you to do whatever.
- You SHOULD NOT use simple merge, but GitHub allow you to use it.

Superlog offer "Ship it" button to help you not make those obvious mistake.

- The button will only shows up for base PR
- It will always uses squash and merge

In addition, Ship it button will also do a git pull on main branch, so that you know your commit get merged successfully.

<Notice title="Equivalent:">

1. Go to GitHub's Pull Request page and click squash and merge.

<Notice title="Why amend instead of commit?">

Many team has discovered the value of keeping the main branch concise without the intermediate "junk" commits.
Which is why they would prefer using "Squash and merge" option when merging the pull request.

If that is the case, maintaining the simple 1 commit per pull request modal, and uses amend to update that 1 commit will have no differences in the end result.
But the workflow suddenly become much simplier and merge conflicts are easier to resolved.

The downside is that GitHub support for comparing between each force-push is not very good.
But this is somewhat bearable because people tend to create smaller, easier to reviewed pull request using Superlog.

Alternatively, there are startups like [https://graphite.dev/](https://graphite.dev/) and [https://www.crocodile.dev/](https://www.crocodile.dev/) that are improving the code review process and have better support over stacked pull request and force pushes.
