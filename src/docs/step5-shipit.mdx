## Ship it! button

When you have a stack of pull requests, merging them in GitHub can be error-prone and tedious:

- You SHOULD merge from the bottom, but GitHub allows you to do whatever.
- You SHOULD use "Squash and merge," but GitHub allows you to use whatever.

Superlog offers "Ship it" button to prevent you from making those obvious mistakes.

- The button will only show up for base PR
- It will always use squash and merge

<Notice title="Equivalent operations">

1. Go to GitHub's Pull Request page and click "Squash and merge."
2. Checkout main branch
3. git pull
4. Checkout previous branch
